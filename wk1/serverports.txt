1.	A server port is a logical construct that identifies a specific process or a type fo network service. 
	A port is identified for each transport protocol and address combination by a 16-bit unsigned number, 
	which is know as the port number

2.	A server port range is a range of port numbers that are used for certain things, specifically there are 3 of them which all span between 0 and 65535.
	There are Well-Known ports, Registered ports, and Dynamic/Private ports.
	Well-Known port numbers include all numbers from 0 - 1023 and are protected ports which allow only processes with appropriate privileges to open ports in this range.
	Registered port numbers include all numbers from 1024 - 49151 and ports used by ordinary user processes, or programs used by ordinary users.
	Dynamic port numbers include all numbers from 49152 - 65535 are not assigned, controlled or registered, and are primarily used for temporary or private ports.

3.	All ports a between 1 and 16 bits long 
	Well-Known ports are between 1 and 10 bits long.
	Registered ports are between 11 and 16 bits long so long as the value is less than 49152.
	Dynamic ports are always 16 bits long as long as the value is equal to or greater than 49152.

4.	Ten common port numbers are:
	-	25 which is used by SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
	-	80 which is used by HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) 
	-	443 which is used by HTTPS (Secure Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)
	-	20 and 21 which are used by FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
	-	23 which is used by TELNET
	-	143 which is used by IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)
	-	3389 which is used by RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)
	-	22 which is used by SSH (Secure Shell)
	-	53 which is used by DNS (Domain Name System)
	-	67 and 68 which are used by DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
	-	110 which is used by POP3 (Post Office Protocol Version 3)
